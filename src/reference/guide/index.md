Getting Started with sbt
========================

sbt uses a small number of concepts to support flexible and powerful
build definitions. There are not that many concepts, but sbt is not
exactly like other build systems and there are details you *will*
stumble on if you haven't read the documentation.

The Getting Started Guide covers the concepts you need to know to create
and maintain an sbt build definition.

It is *highly recommended* to read the Getting Started Guide!
