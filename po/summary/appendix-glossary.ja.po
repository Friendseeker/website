"During library management, when multiple version candidates (e.g. "
"`foo:2.2.0` and `foo:3.0.0`) are found for a library `foo` within a "
"dependency graph, it is called a _dependency conflict_. The process of "
"mediating the conflict into a single version is called _dependency "
"resolution_. Often, this would result in the older version beging removed "
"from the dependency graph, which is called an _eviction_ of `foo:2.2.0`. In "
"some cases, an eviction is considered unsafe because the candidates are not "
"replacable. See [sbt update](../reference/sbt-update.md)."
