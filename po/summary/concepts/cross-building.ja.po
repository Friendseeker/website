"_Cross building_ refers to the idea of building multiple targets from the "
"same set of source file. This includes Scala cross building, targeting "
"multiple versions of Scala releases; platform cross building, targeting JVM, "
"Scala.JS, and Scala Native; and custom virtual axes like Spark versions."

"In the earlier years of Scala (pre-Scala 2.9), the Scala library did not "
"maintain binary compatibility even at the patch level, so each time a new "
"Scala version was released, the libraries had to be re-released against the "
"new version of Scala. This meant that a library user needed to pick a "
"specific version that was compatible with the Scala version they were using."
